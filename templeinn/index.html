                    <p>
                        The Rexburg Idaho Temple is the 125th operating temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<br>
                        Announced in late 2003, it was dedicated on February 10, 2008 and was the first temple dedicated by President Thomas S. Monson.<br> 
                        The temple sits south of the Brigham Young University–Idaho (BYU–Idaho) campus on the south side of Rexburg.<br>
                        Prior to its completion, BYU–Idaho had been the only LDS Church-owned university without a temple adjacent to its campus.
