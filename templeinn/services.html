            <h2>Services and Features</h2>
            <p>
                The services we offer to Latter Day Saints are benefical. For temple patrons, free access to changing rooms and bathroom facilities allows them a place to change to and from church clothes.
                If the patrons have children, we can provide a day-care room and short-term babysitting services.
                Full-time missionaries staying in our establishment can have long term stay accommodations in our kitchenette suites when they require a place to stay.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our unique features provide a visual message that we are a hotel chain that supports Latter Day Saints. Our reception and sitting areas share a temple history theme to allow our guests to feel like they're part of the temple experience without going to the temple.
                The reception hall for weddings held here can be easily customized to serve a simple catering menu and allow kitchen access for food preparation and serving.
                Our business center is a place where family search and ordinance work is supported and can be accomplished.
